### Comments:
I couldn't get the line of code to insert the data to work (using the SQL INSERT statement) so I used the pandas to_sql() function to append the data into the empty table (and because it appends, the table will have repeating data if the .py file is ran more than once). 
The database also wouldn't connect without an absolute path on my computer, but I removed it for your convenience.
